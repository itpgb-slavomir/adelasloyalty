# Adelitas Loyalty
loyalty programme native app

This is a loyalty programme application for a mexican restaurant chain called Las Adelitas in Prague.

## Application will have 3 types of users
1. Custommers / consumers
2. Cashiers
3. Administrators

### Back-end
Test https://www.npmjs.com/package/barcode-reader for reading bar codes. And develop a method to transfer information about purchase to custommers account using a barcode or a qr code. (We need to brainstorm about this.)
App will be build using Pro MERN Stack React, Mongo, Express with a node.js for backend. It´s purpose is to test functions of loyalty programme and to assure it will add to company's great success.

### Front-end
For front-end we could use facebook.github.io › react-native
For design I will use Figma and and the design will be automatically updated in the front end using
https://github.com/rtg0770/designtokens
and
https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/

Design of AdelasLoyalty in a Figma file: https://www.figma.com/file/wBhrKxzQznvWBQekyQe0xd/lasadelitas?node-id=0%3A1

### Dry
Patricio: "In future there will be another internal informational application for onboarding of new employees, and with another functions."
So lets have all the components and design consistent and lets create a usefull and DRY code.
