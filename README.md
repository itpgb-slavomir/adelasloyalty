# adelasloyalty
loyalty programme native app

This is a loyalty programme application for a mexican restaurant chain called Las Adelitas in Prague.

App will be build using Pro MERN Stack React, Mongo, Express with a node.js for backend. It´s purpose is to test functions of loyalty programme and to assure this won´t disturb company´s great success.

Application will have 3 types of users
1. Custommers / consumers
2. Cashiers
3. Administrators

Idea is to use node.js for back-end. Test https://www.npmjs.com/package/barcode-reader for reading bar codes. And develop a method to transfer information about purchase to custommers account using a barcode or a qr code. (We need to brainstorm about this.)

For front-end we could use facebook.github.io › react-native
For design I will use Figma and and the design will be automatically updated in the front end using

and

Patricio: "In future there will be another internal informational application for onboarding of new employees, and with another functions."
So lets have all the components and design consistent and lets create a usefull and DRY code.
